# Curriculum Vitae

This repository provides a class for LaTeX to create a curriculum vitae (CV) inside the file [`cv.cls`](cv.cls).
Its basic usage is shown in [`main.tex`](main.tex) which is the source code for [my own CV](main.pdf).
The CV style was inspired by [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).
